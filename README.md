This repo is super rough.

# Introduction

What should someone who walks onto a UNOLS vessel have in hand to help them
collect better data and how do we as a community help folks dealing with the
data after cruises.  While we need to mention the commercial software packages,
we should focus on the open data and open source side of things.  There are hand
books out there and there is the are classes you can take, but they are almost
all very expensive and not something where people have a license to modify them
too fix or add material.

The goal is to be at a baseline the equivalent to Marine Geophysics by
E. J. W. Jones, but always evolving and more focused on actually working with
sensors and data.

I feel like I’ve started this sort of document before, but I don’t seem to have
it.  My blog and my 2012 research tools class were this sort of thing.

This is a GitHub repository so that the community can contribute.

Not sure how to handle larger media files.
