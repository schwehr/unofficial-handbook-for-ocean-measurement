What is the name of this thing from SIO MPL in 2006?


The shape and composition of the seafloor


Lead line


Depth and with wax or other sticky substance can return a bit of the sea floor.  That can be good for geology and can also bea used for location if there are known bottom types


Example of using a line in Mono Lake for depth.


Single Beam Echo Sounder (SBES)


Why might you use a single Beam system when there are now MBES and all sorts of other systems?


* Probably Simpler, cheaper, and more
* All the power goes into one result


MultiBeam Echo Sounder


Mills cross


When to discuss down versus forward sonars?

Underwater stereovision




Stereo imagery of the propeller of the USCG Polar Star collected and processed by the Ames Stero pipeline in 1997 by Alex Derbes.  http://schwehr.org/blog/archives/2008-07.html / http://vislab-ccom.unh.edu/~schwehr/papers/schwehr-etal-vda05.pdf


A researcher I know always complained around 2007 that underwater stereo was too hard because of particulate material and things moving in currents


Calibration rigs e.g. what Monica did in the test tank.  And Amy's comment about qr codes (or similar) in the test targets


Tips and tricks of lighting


* Using lasers to get distance by observing where they hit things
* Having the light sources as far away from the cameras as possible

Cruise documentation


General writing suggestions
* Tools for latex and templates
* Using Jupyter Notebooks
* Git and version control
* Document, spreadsheet, slides: Microsoft tools, Apple’s, Google’s, open source


Proposals for ship time


Who is willing to share proposal for ship time?


Documentation while at sea


Things can be a bit challenging at sea with much less access to the internet and being out of your normal environment


* Tools for recording
   * Paper log books
   * Log books.  Elog and?
   * Shared docs without internet?
* Managing photos, pictures, video, audio etc.
* Template documents
* What if you do have access to full internet?  E.g. streaming live


Archiving the data


Cruise reports


What are some sample cruise reports?








https://ccom.unh.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Mayer_2011_cruise_report_HEALY1102.pdf
https://ccom.unh.edu/sites/default/files/publications/KM1811-Cruise-Report.pdf




Publications from a cruise


* Examples of common types of papers that are cruise focused
* How to refer to cruises and data
* Who to acknowledge


Tips on retrieving lost gear


Things happen at sea.  Sometimes you are unable to retrieve your gear.  A line is broken, a line is hung up on something, a release won’t trigger, etc.


* Insurance
* A cable around your propeller




Loss of the magnetometer on 2002-12-23 on NBP0209.  When the 2nd mate stopped the ship while it was towing the maggi and ice breaking, the ice closed up and there was no way to retrieve the sensor.  The techs had to cut the cable.

Open / repeatable designs


If you are contracting for work, consider making a part of the contract be that the design be made open for others to use.  There is a tension between being open and being able to make money, but there are ways to handle this.  With hardware, c.f. RISC-V and SiFive


Why open?


* You and others can see and understand the design as needed for maintenance and analysis
* Folks being systems can more easy use open components
* The community can more easily review the designs and help with innovation


Legal and regulatory issues

S6x - Verizon Hyper Precise Location RINEX BaseStation Files SanFrancisco Bay Area v4
Verizon has built and deployed a nationwide network of RTK reference stations to provide centimeter level accuracy to RTK compatible IoT and mobile devices – for use cases within automotive, mapping, drones and asset tracking. Verizon’s network provides GNSS satellite information, and combined with an RTK algorithm on the device, a hyper precise solution can be derived. This service can be utilized in either real time or post-processed scenarios.

Debugging Hardware


What are good stories that demonstrate how to find and fix problems?


* Electrical or acoustic crosstalk. Eg the boss sonar contract with ? In NH around 2006  L3/Klein?
* Hard drives putting noise on em receivers
* Edgetech copper base plate for power that went up to the edge of the bottle and the horrible short/fire that happened on Driscoll’s chirp circa 2007
* General grounding
* Damage from not having grapple points.  Art's first AUV.
* Wheels that are not up for sand
* Duct tape and mono Lake
* Time drift with temp xtal oscillators
* Have the specs and spare parts
* Self tests and tracking the quality of sensors. Eg Kognsberg sonar on ? In Oregon
* Radio issues
* Alternative ways to announce location
* Rub test
* Hardware watchdogs


Debugging Software


* Security
* Logging and interrupts
* Version control
* LabVIEW and Matlab downfalls
* Unit and Integration tests
* Network data corruption
* Backups
* Logging not just the data
* Health monitoring. Nagios opennmp
